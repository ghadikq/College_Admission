# College Admission

## Stage 3: Machine Learning Discovery

In this project, I wanted to create a model to predict if a high school student will be admitted into college based on elements provided in my dataset like GPA, GRE, and Rank.<br />
This project has a challenge which is a small dataset so I try to deal with the challenge using different methods to create the prediction model.<br />
Also, I implement the project in both R and Python.<br />

## What done in this project?

- EDA<br />
- Clean dataset.<br />
- Organize dataset columns types.<br />
- Provide a chart to understand data.<br />
- Work on predict catagorical value yes/no and try 3 different model on it.<br />

- Machine Learning Models:<br />
    * Logistic Regression<br />
    * GBM <br />
    * Random Forest <br />
    * Extra:KNN <br />
